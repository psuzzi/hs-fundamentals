== What to install 

Kurzgesagt, this is how to setup the development environment to program in Haskell

----
# install stack and upgrade, as usually outdated
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
stack upgrade
# installs a version of sandboxed ghc
stack setup

# vscode needs to locate the ghc compiler on path
sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
----

Besides, I also installed _VSCode_ with the Haskell extension.
