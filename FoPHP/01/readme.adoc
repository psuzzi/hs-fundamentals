In short that is about installing and testing

== Installing Stack on Linux

Installing on Ubuntu. Most straightforward way

[,bash]
----
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

#check
which stack
----


Stack will place the binaries it builds in "/home/$USER/.local/bin", so you might want to add the folder to the path.

[,bash]
----
export PATH=$PATH:"/home/$USER/.local/bin"
----

== Create new program, build and exec

[,bash]
----
stack new hello-world simple --resolver=lts-7.8
cd hello-world
stack build
stack exec hello-world
----

To clean the built artifacts, we can run `stack clean` or `stack purge`.

== Just interpret

In case you have your `Program.hs` you can also just intepret and run it

[,bash]
----
stack runghc Program.hs
----
